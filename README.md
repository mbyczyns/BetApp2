Project Java - BetApp
Marcin Byczy≈Ñski L9, 155888

My project is an app similair to Betclic. It is called BetApp. You log in as a user, and you choose what discipline you want to bet. You put money (virtual) on a coupon, if all the bets you made on the coupon are correct, you win money, if the bets were wrong, you loose the money. Simple. There are 2 disciplines to choose from : Football match between FC Barcelona and Real Madrid, and a simple Diceroll. 



Status : ALMOST FINISHED
