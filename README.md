Project Java - BetApp
Marcin Byczy≈Ñski L9, 155888

My project is an app similair to Betclic. It is called BetApp. You log in as an existing user, or create a new user account. When you log in you choose what discipline you want to bet. You put money (virtual) on a coupon, if all the bets you made on the coupon are correct, you win money, if the bets were wrong, you loose the money. Simple. There are 2 disciplines to choose from : Football match between FC Barcelona and Real Madrid, and a simple Diceroll.

If you want to log in as an existing user:

    username: user
    password: password

By default, your wallet has 100 $, but you can add more money if you need. You can also cash out the money you got.

Status : FINISHED
